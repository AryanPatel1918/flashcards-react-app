        question: "What are the main natural and human-induced factors that influence the Earth's climate system, and how have human activities contributed to the observed rise in global temperatures over the past century?",
        answer: "The Earth's climate system is shaped by both natural and anthropogenic influences. Natural factors include variations in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions that release aerosols into the atmosphere, and internal variability such as oceanic cycles like El Niño and La Niña. However, human activities—particularly since the Industrial Revolution—have added large amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere through fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes. These gases intensify the natural greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and causing a measurable increase in global temperatures. This warming has led to shifts in weather patterns, melting polar ice, and rising sea levels, all of which have significant environmental and societal impacts."
