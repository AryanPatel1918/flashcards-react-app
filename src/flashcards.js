        question: "The Earth's climate system is influenced by a complex combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Natural elements include variations in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions that release aerosols into the atmosphere, and internal variability such as oceanic cycles (e.g., El Niño and La Niña). Human activities, particularly since the Industrial Revolution, have added significant amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere through fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes. These gases trap heat, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and i thought this would never exist because whatever leading to global warming. The interaction between natural variability and human-induced changes has caused a marked and measurable rise in global average temperatures, disruptions in weather patterns, melting of polar ice, and rising sea levels.",
